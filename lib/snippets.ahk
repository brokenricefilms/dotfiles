Hi,

I have experience working with a travel vlog youtube channel with over 50,000 subscribers.

Here are some examples of travel vlogs I edited:
- https://vimeo.com/952803807
- https://vimeo.com/952798464
- https://vimeo.com/952798415

You can also check out my portfolio: https://vndmp4.pages.dev/portfolio

Let's delve into your project:
- Could you share an example video that represents the style you're aiming for?
- How many videos do you plan to assign to me if the first task goes well?
- Are there any color palettes, style guides, or branding guidelines I should follow during editing?

Thanks,
Thuan pham
