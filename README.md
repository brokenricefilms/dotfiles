Config for windows, nothing fancy, minimal nvim for coding, pwsh for easy life in windows

The fedora linux config backup in the v4 tag for the fancy programming focus 

I hate coding in Windows btw 

## Firefox

```js
// fak animation
full-screen-api.transition-duration.enter = "0 0"
full-screen-api.transition-duration.leave = "0 0" 
```
