## About

- For me, dotfiles is very personal, but you can find some tips, tricks, functions i used in this repos
- Since i spend too much time to config the perfect setup, i didn't code, speed time to build better software.
-> So I just delete all fancy stuff, and don't give shit about my setup, these i keep for my own make me feel like home, cozy.
