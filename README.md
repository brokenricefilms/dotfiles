## About

- For me, Dotfiles are very personal, but you can find some tips, tricks, and functions I used in this repo.
- Watch my live-stream playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcazFfFZIFPld0UvU7OxYl6ayyBJ6MvY7) for a demo.

## Current setup

- Fedora 37
- Gnome terminal
- [Tmux](./tmux/tmux.conf
- [Bash shell](./bashrc)
- [Neovim](./init.lua): no plugin, no lsp, just Neovim with some config
- VSCode: Vim plugin, github light theme, no fancy AI, and some stuff for a front-end developer
