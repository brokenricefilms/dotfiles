## About

- For me, Dotfiles are very personal, but you can find some tips, tricks, and
  functions I used in this repo Since I spend too much time config the perfect
  setup, I didn't code, the speed time to build better software. -> So I just
  delete all fancy stuff, and don't give a shit about my setup, these I keep for
  my own make me feel at home, and cozy.
- If you want to see the fancy dotfile, go to v2.1:
  https://github.com/thuanOwa/dotfiles/releases/tag/v2.1

## Current setup:

- Windows 11
- WSL2 runs Ubuntu by default, vscode backend, and all my coding stuff will be
  in the WSL folder
