## About

- For me, dotfiles is very personal, but you can find some tips, tricks,
  functions i used in this repos
- Since i spend too much time to config the perfect setup, i didn't code, speed
  time to build better software. -> So I just delete all fancy stuff, and don't
  give shit about my setup, these i keep for my own make me feel like home,
  cozy.

> if you want see the fancy dotfile, go to v2.1:
> https://github.com/thuanOwa/dotfiles/releases/tag/v2.1
