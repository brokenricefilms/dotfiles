## feature

- Auto switch (dark | light) theme
  - using `dark | light` in command line
  - change nvim & kitty & batcat theme
- vim keymap everywhere
  - philosophy: replace (Caps Lock) for vim keymap when you pressed `caps lock` left hand (busy), right hand (free) so I prefer mod these key your right hand can press
  - using Xmodmap
  - `h,j,k,l` (left, down, up, right)
  - `i` (HOME), `o` (END)
